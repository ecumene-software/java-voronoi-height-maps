###What are voronoi diagrams?
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram
 
###What are heightmaps?
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heightmap
 
###Why isn't this working?
Because I didn't test it, I decoupled this from my science fair project and didn't include all the proprietary stuffs from it :/
If you're reading this, and you know the error but are too lazy to make a push just let me know and I'll fix it. 
( Chances are it's HeightMap.clip... I didn't test it yet ;( )
